# Electric_Grid_Stability_Classifiction
Electrical grids require a balance between electricity supply and demand in order to be stable. For future grids with a high share of inflexible (i.e., renewable) energy sources, the concept of demand  response is a promising solution.  weâ€™ll build a binary classification model to predict if a grid is stable or unstable
